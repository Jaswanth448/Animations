It's the backbone of a website, providing the structure and content that the web browser renders to the user. HTML consists of a series of elements, represented by tags, which are used to wrap around content and apply meaning to it.</p>
	<h3><mark><i>CSS</i></mark>  :-</h3>
	<p>CSS, or "<u><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b></u>", is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages. It allows developers to separate content from design, making it easier to maintain and update websites.</p>
